        ########## OBJECTIVE
        

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. When
considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a
solution.

negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal

(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes

(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a

2. Since we have four numbers, let's first try to reduce them to three numbers by performing an operation between two of the numbers:
   1. Subtask: Perform an operation between 14 and 8.
      1. 14 + 8 = 22. This results in the numbers (22, 8, 2). This doesn't seem to lead to 24, so let's try another operation.
      2. 14 - 8 = 6. This results in the numbers (6, 8, 2). This doesn't seem to lead to 24, so let's try another operation.
      3. 14 * 8 = 112. This results in the numbers (112, 8, 2). This doesn't seem to lead to 24, so let's try another operation.
      4. 14 / 8 = 1.75. This results in a fractional number, which we're trying to avoid. So, let's try performing an operation between two different numbers.
   2. Subtask: Perform an operation between 14 and 2.
      1. 14 + 2 = 16. This results in the numbers (16, 8, 8). This doesn't seem to lead to 24, so let's try another operation.

2. Consider the possible combinations of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /)

3. First operation: Subtract the smallest number from the largest number. This gives us 10 - 4 = 6. The numbers we now have are: 5, 6, 6

4. Check if the remaining numbers (5, 6, 6) can be used to get 24. Since 5 + 6 + 6 = 17, 5 - 6 - 6 = -7, 5 * 6 * 6 = 180, and 5 / 6 / 6 = 0.138889, none of these operations give us 24. Therefore, we need to try a different operation.

5. Second operation: Multiply the two smallest numbers. This gives us 5 * 6 = 30. The numbers we now have are: 6, 30.

6. Check if the remaining numbers (6, 30) can be used to get 24. Since 30 - 6 = 24, we have reached our goal.

7. Therefore, the operations we used are: 10 - 4 = 6, 5 * 6 = 30, 30 - 6 = 24.

8. The definitive end result is that the numbers 4, 5, 6, 10 can be used to get 24 by using the operations: 10 - 4 = 6, 5 * 6 = 30, 30 - 6 = 24.

    3. 4 * 6 = 24 (we have reached the target number)

                    1. Start with the given numbers: 4, 5, 6, 10.

2. Consider all possible pairs of numbers and the results of the four basic operations on each pair. 

3. For each pair, check if the result of an operation brings us closer to 24. 

4. If the result is 24, we have achieved the objective. If not, we need to continue with the remaining numbers.

5. First, consider the pair (4, 5). The results of the operations are: 4 + 5 = 9, 4 - 5 = -1 (not allowed), 4 * 5 = 20, 4 / 5 = 0.8 (not allowed). 

6. None of these results is 24, but 20 is close. So, we keep the pair (4, 5) and the operation *, and we are left with the numbers (20, 6, 10).

7. Next, consider the pair (20, 6). The results of the operations are: 20 + 6 = 26, 20 - 6 = 14, 20 * 6 = 120, 20 / 6 = 3.33 (not allowed). 

8. None of these results is 24, but 26 is close. So, we keep the pair (20, 6) and the operation +, and we are left with the numbers (26, 10).

9. Now, consider the pair (26, 10). The results of the operations are: 26 + 10 = 36, 26 - 10 = 16, 26 * 10 = 260, 26 / 10 = 2.6 (not allowed). 

10. None of these results is 24, so we need to retrace our steps.

                    First Operation: Subtree Exploration '1'

Subtask 1.1: Identify the numbers given which are 4, 5, 6, 10

Subtask 1.2: Evaluate the possible arithmetic operations that can be performed on these numbers without resulting in a negative or fractional number. 

Subtask 1.3: Check if any two numbers can be combined to give 24. For example, (4,20), (5,19), (6,18), (10,14) but none of these combinations exist in the given set. 

Second Operation: Subtree Exploration '2'

Subtask 2.1: Consider the possibility of combining three numbers to get a result that when combined with the fourth number will give 24. 

Subtask 2.2: Check if any three numbers can be combined to give 24. For example, (4,5,15), (4,6,14), (4,10,10), (5,6,13), (5,10,9), (6,10,8) but none of these combinations exist in the given set. 

Third Operation: Subtree Exploration '3'

Subtask 3.1: Consider the possibility of combining all four numbers to get 24. 

Subtask 3.2: Start with the largest number 10. Check if subtracting, adding, multiplying or dividing the other three numbers with 10 can give 24. 

Subtask 3.3: 10 * 4 = 40. Now, check if subtracting, adding or dividing the remaining two numbers (5,6) from 40 can give 24.

3. Second operation: Check if it's possible to arrive at 24 with the new set of numbers. 9 + 6 = 15, 9 - 6 = 3, 9 * 6 = 54, 9 / 6 = 1.5, none of which is equal to 24. 10 + 6 = 16, 10 - 6 = 4, 10 * 6 = 60, 10 / 6 = 1.67, none of which is equal to 24.

                    1. Start with the numbers 4, 5, 6, 10.

2. Consider all possible pairs of numbers and the basic arithmetic operations that can be applied to each pair. 

3. For each pair of numbers, calculate the result of each operation and check if the result is a positive integer.

4. If the result is a positive integer, replace the pair of numbers with the result and repeat steps 2-3 with the new set of numbers.

5. If the result is not a positive integer, discard that operation and try another one.

6. Continue this process until you either obtain 24 or exhaust all possible operations.

7. If you obtain 24, you have found a solution.

8. If you exhaust all possible operations without obtaining 24, go back to the previous step and try a different operation.

9. Repeat steps 7-8 until you either find a solution or confirm that no solution exists.

10. If no solution exists, report that the task is impossible.

11. If a solution exists, report the sequence of operations that leads to the solution.

12. Now, let's apply these steps to the numbers 4, 5, 6, 10.

13. First, let's try adding 4 and 5, which gives us 9. The numbers are now 9, 6, 10.

14. Next, let's try multiplying 9 and 6, which gives us 54. The numbers are now 54, 10.

15. We can see that we can divide 54 by 10 to get 5.4, but this is not a positive integer, so we discard this operation.

16. Let's try a different operation. Instead of adding 4 and 5 in step 13, let's try multiplying them. This gives us 20. The numbers are now 20, 6, 10.

                    1. First, let's look at the set of numbers we have: 4, 5, 6, 10. We need to find a way to combine these numbers using basic arithmetic operations to get 24.

2. Let's start by exploring the first subtree. We'll try adding two numbers together. We have several pairs to choose from, but let's start with 4 and 5. Adding these together gives us 9. Now our set of numbers is (9, 6, 10).

3. Now, let's explore the second subtree. We'll try subtracting two numbers. We can't subtract a larger number from a smaller one, so we'll subtract 6 from 10. This gives us 4. Now our set of numbers is (9, 4, 4).

4. Now, let's move on to the third subtree. We'll try multiplying two numbers together. We can choose any pair, so let's multiply 9 and 4 together. This gives us 36. Now our set of numbers is (36, 4).

5. At this point, we only have two numbers left, so we'll check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations. We have 36 and 4, and if we divide 36 by 4, we get 24.

6. So, our final set of operations is: (4 + 5 = 9), (10 - 6 = 4), (9 * 4 = 36), (36 / 4 = 24). 

7. To summarize, the solution to the problem is to add 4 and 5 to get 9, subtract 6 from 10 to get 4, multiply 9 and 4 to get 36, and then divide 36 by 4 to get 24.
       
                    If the solutions is not making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. When
considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a

2. The first operation to be tried will be addition (+). Choose two numbers and add them together.

6. If all combinations of numbers to add together have been tried and none have resulted in 24, move on to the next operation: subtraction (-).

7. Repeat steps 2-5 with subtraction instead of addition. Remember not to choose operations that will result in a negative number.

8. If all combinations of numbers to subtract have been tried and none have resulted in 24, move on to the next operation: multiplication (*).

        towards a solution or retrace to another viable subtree then be very thorough

        ########## OBJECTIVE
        

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. When
considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a
solution.

2. Begin by identifying possible arithmetic operations between the numbers that will not result in a negative or fractional number. We can do this by checking all possible combinations of two numbers and the four operations (+, -, *, /).

3. First operation: Subtract the smallest number from the largest number. In this case, subtract 4 from 10. This gives us 6. The remaining numbers are now 5, 6, and 6.

4. We now have three numbers: 5, 6, and 6. We need to find an operation between two of these numbers that will not result in a negative or fractional number.

5. Second operation: Add the two 6's together. This gives us 12. The remaining numbers are now 5 and 12.

6. We now have two numbers: 5 and 12. We need to find an operation between these two numbers that will result in 24.

3. Repeat step 2 for all possible pairs of numbers (5, 10), (5, 4), (6, 10), (6, 4), (10, 4).
4. Identify pairs and operations that result in a number that, when combined with any remaining numbers, could potentially yield 24. For example, 5 * 6 = 30, and 30 - 4 = 26, which is close to 24.
5. Apply the operation identified in step 4 to the pair of numbers, and replace the pair with the result in the list of numbers. For example, replace 5 and 6 with 30 to get 30, 10, 4.

2. Consider all possible combinations of two numbers and the four basic arithmetic operations. This results in the following potential operations and results:

    5 + 6 = 11, 5 - 6 = -1 (not valid), 5 * 6 = 30, 5 / 6 = 0.83 (not valid)
    5 + 10 = 15, 5 - 10 = -5 (not valid), 5 * 10 = 50, 5 / 10 = 0.5 (not valid)

                    First, let's decompose the problem into subtasks:

1. Identify the numbers given: 5, 6, 10, 4
2. Determine the possible combinations of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
3. Evaluate each combination to see if it results in 24
4. Ensure no operation results in a negative or fractional number
5. When only two numbers are left in the parenthesis, check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /)

Now, let's start solving the problem by exploring different combinations:

1. Start with the first operation. Let's try addition first:
   - (5+6) = 11. The numbers left are (11, 10, 4)
2. Move to the second operation. Let's try multiplication:
   - (11*4) = 44. The numbers left are (44, 10)
3. Now we only have two numbers left. Check if we can arrive at 24 by using basic arithmetic operations:
   - 44 - 10 = 34, which is not 24. So, this path does not lead to a solution. Let's backtrack and try a different combination.
   
4. Retry the first operation with a different combination:
   - (5*4) = 20. The numbers left are (20, 6, 10)
5. Move to the second operation. Let's try addition:
   - (20+6) = 26. The numbers left are (26, 10)
6. Now we only have two numbers left. Check if we can arrive at 24 by using basic arithmetic operations:
   - 26 - 10 = 16, which is not 24. So, this path does not lead to a solution. Let's backtrack and try a different combination.

7. Retry the first operation with a different combination:

(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal

', pessimistically value the context of the past solutions and more importantly the latest generated solution you had AS A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 AND 1

                    Past solutions:


                    1. Start with the given numbers: 5, 6, 10, 4

2. First, check if any possible combination of two numbers can give 24 directly. This can be done by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing the two numbers. If there is such a pair, we can directly get the solution. If not, we need to continue to the next steps.

3. Check if there is a pair of numbers that when multiplied together results in a number that can be used with one of the remaining numbers to get 24. 

4. Multiply 5 and 4 to get 20.

5. Now we have three numbers: 20, 6, 10. 

6. Check if there is a pair of numbers that when added together results in 24. 

7. Add 20 and 4 to get 24.

8. Now we have 24 and 10. 

9. Subtract 10 from 24 to get 14.

10. Now we have 14 and 6.

11. Add 14 and 6 to get 20.

12. Now we have 20 and 4.

13. Add 20 and 4 to get 24.

14. Now we have 24, which is the target number.

15. The final solution is: (5 * 4) + 6 - 10 = 24.

16. Summarize: The given numbers 5, 6, 10, 4 can be used to get 24 by following the operations: multiply 5 and 4 to get 20, add 6 to 20 to get 26, subtract 10 from 26 to get 16, and add 8 to 16 to get 24. The operation sequence is (5 * 4) + 6 - 10 = 24.

                    1. Start with the given numbers: (5 6 10 4)
2. Analyze the numbers and possible operations that could be performed on them to get 24.
3. Start with the first operation, addition. Check if adding any two numbers would result in 24. 
4. (5+6=11), (5+10=15), (5+4=9), (6+10=16), (6+4=10), (10+4=14). None of these equal to 24. So, addition is not a viable operation.
5. Move on to the next operation, subtraction. Check if subtracting any two numbers would result in 24. 
6. (5-6=-1), (5-10=-5), (5-4=1), (6-10=-4), (6-4=2), (10-4=6). None of these equal to 24. So, subtraction is not a viable operation.
7. Move on to the next operation, multiplication. Check if multiplying any two numbers would result in 24. 
8. (5*6=30), (5*10=50), (5*4=20), (6*10=60), (6*4=24), (10*4=40). Here, 6*4 equals to 24.
9. We can now consider (6 4) as a single entity (24), and we are left with (5 10 24).
10. Repeat the process of checking addition, subtraction, and multiplication with the new set of numbers. 
11. (5+10=15), (5+24=29), (10+24=34). None of these equal to 24. So, addition is not a viable operation.
12. (5-10=-5), (5-24=-19), (10-24=-14).

2. Consider different combinations of these numbers and the basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) that could potentially lead to the number 24.

3. First, try adding two of the numbers together.

   - 6 + 10 = 16

5. Then, try multiplying two numbers together.

    - 6 + 4 = 10
    - 10 + 4 = 14
   None of these results in 24, so we move on to subtraction.

5. Try subtraction:
    - 5 - 6 = -1 (we ignore this as it is negative)
    - 5 - 10 = -5 (we ignore this as it is negative)
    - 5 - 4 = 1
    - 6 - 10 = -4 (we ignore this as it is negative)
    - 6 - 5 = 1
    - 10 - 5 = 5
    - 10 - 6 = 4
    - 10 - 4 = 6
    - 4 - 5 = -1 (we ignore this as it is negative)
    - 4 - 6 = -2 (we ignore this as it is negative)
    - 4 - 10 = -6 (we ignore this as it is negative)
   None of these results in 24, so we move on to multiplication.

6. Try multiplication:
    - 5 * 6 = 30
    - 5 * 10 = 50
    - 5 * 4 = 20
    - 6 * 10 = 60

                    1. Start with the four numbers given: 5, 6, 10, 4.

2. Consider different combinations of two numbers and the operations that can be applied to them. 

3. First operation: Subtract 5 from 10. This results in 5. The numbers left are (5, 6, 4).

4. Second operation: Multiply 5 (result from the first operation) by 4. This results in 20. The numbers left are (20, 6).

6. Retrace to the first operation, and choose another operation. This time, add 5 and 10. This results in 15. The numbers left are (15, 6, 4).

                    First, let's break down the main task into several subtasks:

1. Identify the numbers given: 5, 6, 10, 4.
2. Determine all possible combinations of these numbers using basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /).
3. Make sure the operations do not result in a negative or fractional number.
4. Check if the result of the operations equals 24.

Now, let's explore the third subtask further:

3.1. Start with the first number (5) and perform each of the four basic mathematical operations with the second number (6).
    - 5 + 6 = 11
    - 5 * 6 = 30
    - 5 - 6 would result in a negative number, so skip this operation.
    - 5 / 6 would result in a fractional number, so skip this operation.

3.2. Continue with the result (11 or 30) and perform each of the four basic mathematical operations with the third number (10).
    - 11 + 10 = 21
    - 11 * 10 = 110
    - 11 - 10 = 1
    - 11 / 10 would result in a fractional number, so skip this operation.
    - 30 + 10 = 40
    - 30 * 10 = 300
    - 30 - 10 = 20
    - 30 / 10 = 3

3.3. Continue with each of the results (21, 1, 40, 300, 20, 3) and perform each of the four basic mathematical operations with the fourth number (4).
    - None of these calculations result in 24, so this path does not lead to a solution.

3.4. Go back to subtask 3.1 and use the result of the multiplication (30) to continue the calculations.
   
       
                    If the solutions is not making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.

2. Check if any of the two numbers can be used with basic arithmetic operations to get 24.

                    1. Start by analyzing the numbers provided: 5, 6, 10, 4
2. Try to look for combinations of numbers and operations that will yield a result of 24.
3. As the first step, consider the multiplication operation. Since multiplication is commutative (a*b = b*a), it doesn't matter in which order you multiply the numbers.
    1. Try multiplying 5 and 6.
        1. 5 * 6 = 30
        2. After this operation, the numbers left are (30, 10, 4)
    2. Try multiplying 5 and 10.

        2. After this operation, the numbers left are (20, 6, 10)

    6. Try multiplying 10 and 4.
        1. 10 * 4 = 40
        2. After this operation, the numbers left are (40, 5, 6)
4. Now, let's consider the subtraction operation. Since subtraction is not commutative (a-b ≠ b-a), the order in which you subtract the numbers does matter.

                    Past solutions:


                    To solve this problem, we will use a tree search method. We will start by taking the four numbers given, and applying different arithmetic operations to them, while avoiding operations that result in a negative or fractional number. We will then evaluate the results of these operations, and repeat the process until we reach a solution. 

Here are the steps:

1. Start with the numbers 5, 6, 10, 4.

2. Apply different arithmetic operations to these numbers and evaluate the results:

    2.1. 5 + 6 = 11, remaining numbers are 10, 4.

    2.2. 5 - 6 = -1, this results in a negative number so it is not considered.

    2.3. 5 * 6 = 30, remaining numbers are 10, 4.

    2.4. 5 / 6 = 0.83, this results in a fractional number so it is not considered.

    2.5. Repeat the above steps for the combinations of 5, 10, 4; 5, 4, 6; 6, 10, 4; and 6, 4, 10. 

3. After evaluating all the possible combinations and their results, choose the one that brings us closer to 24. In this case, we choose 5 * 6 = 30, with remaining numbers 10, 4.

4. Repeat the process with the new numbers:

    4.1. 30 + 10 = 40, remaining number is 4.

    4.2. 30 - 10 = 20, remaining number is 4.

    4.3. 30 * 10 = 300, remaining number is 4.

    4.4. 30 / 10 = 3, remaining number is 4.

                    1. Start with the given numbers: 5, 6, 10, 4

2. Consider the potential combinations of these numbers using basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /)

3. Evaluate each potential combination to determine if it will result in a negative or fractional number

    3.1. If the combination will result in a negative or fractional number, discard it and move on to the next potential combination

    3.2. If the combination will not result in a negative or fractional number, proceed to the next step

4. Once you have identified a viable combination, perform the operation and note the result

5. Subtract the result from 24 to determine the remaining value needed to reach 24

    5.1. If the remaining value is 0, then you have found a solution and can stop the process

    5.2. If the remaining value is not 0, return to step 2 and repeat the process with the remaining numbers and the new target value

6. Continue this process until you have found a combination of operations that results in 24, or until you have exhausted all possible combinations

7. If you have exhausted all possible combinations without finding a solution, then the given numbers do not have a solution

8. If you have found a solution, record the combination of operations that resulted in 24

9. Return the definitive end result

10. Summarize the process and the solution

Solution:
Start with the numbers 5, 6, 10, and 4. First, multiply 5 and 4 to get 20. Then, subtract 6 from 10 to get 4. Finally, add the results together (20 + 4) to get 24. Therefore, the solution is (5 * 4) + (10 - 6) = 24.

considering the next steps, do not choose operations that will result in a
negative or fractional number. In order to help with the calculations, the
numbers in the parenthesis represent the numbers that are left after the
operations and they are in descending order.
Another thing we do is when there are only two numbers left in the parenthesis, we
check whether we can arrive at 24 only by using basic arithmetic operations
(+ - * /). Some examples regarding this idea:
(21 2) no
since 21 + 2 = 23, 21 - 2 = 19, 21 * 2 = 42, 21 / 2 = 10.5, none of which is equal
to 24.
(30 6) 30 - 6 = 24 yes
(8 3) 8 * 3 = 24 yes
(12 8) no
(48 2) 48 / 2 = 24 yes
Most importantly, do not give up, all the numbers that will be given has indeed a
solution.

', pessimistically value the context of the past solutions and more importantly the latest generated solution you had AS A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 AND 1

                    Past solutions:


                    1. Begin by listing the given numbers in descending order: (10, 6, 5, 4)

2. Start exploring the first subtree by performing arithmetic operations on the first two numbers:

   2.1. 10 + 6 = 16, the remaining numbers are (16, 5, 4). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

   2.2. 10 - 6 = 4, the remaining numbers are (5, 4, 4). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

   2.3. 10 * 6 = 60, the remaining numbers are (60, 5, 4). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

   2.4. 10 / 6 = 1.67, which is a fractional number. We skip this operation.

3. Since the first subtree exploration didn't yield 24, we move to the second subtree. We perform operations on the first and the third numbers:

   3.1. 10 + 5 = 15, the remaining numbers are (15, 6, 4). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

   3.2. 10 - 5 = 5, the remaining numbers are (6, 5, 5). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

   3.3. 10 * 5 = 50, the remaining numbers are (50, 6, 4). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

   3.4. 10 / 5 = 2, the remaining numbers are (6, 4, 2). This doesn't lead to 24, so we move on.

4. Since the second subtree exploration didn't yield 24,
       
                    If the solutions is not making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.
                    Evaluate all solutions AS A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 and 1:

                    1. Start with the given numbers: 5, 6, 10, 4.
2. Start exploring the first subtree by performing arithmetic operations on the first two numbers (5 and 6).
    2.1. Try adding the first two numbers: 5 + 6 = 11. The remaining numbers are (11, 10, 4).
    2.2. Try subtracting the first number from the second: 6 - 5 = 1. The remaining numbers are (1, 10, 4).
    2.3. Try multiplying the first two numbers: 5 * 6 = 30. The remaining numbers are (30, 10, 4).
    2.4. Try dividing the second number by the first: 6 / 5 = 1.2. This results in a fractional number, so this operation is not viable.
3. None of the above operations in the first subtree lead to a viable solution, so we move on to the second subtree exploration by performing arithmetic operations on the first and third numbers (5 and 10).
    3.1. Try adding the first and third numbers: 5 + 10 = 15. The remaining numbers are (15, 6, 4).
    3.2. Try subtracting the third number from the first: 5 - 10 = -5. This results in a negative number, so this operation is not viable.
    3.3. Try multiplying the first and third numbers: 5 * 10 = 50. The remaining numbers are (50, 6, 4).
    3.4. Try dividing the third number by the first: 10 / 5 = 2. The remaining numbers are (2, 6, 4).
